function classifier = sacTrain_LogisticRegression_Weka(data, parameters)
% classifier = sacTrain_Logistic_Weka(data, parameters)
% Trains a logistic regression classifier using the WEKA library. 
%
% INPUT:
%  data:            a sac data structure containing the training data
%  parameters:      a string containing options for training. Options
%                   include
%                   -norm Data normalization type
%                   -M maxits: maximum number of iterations
%                   -R ridgeval: the Ridge value in the log-likelihood
%
% OUTPUT:
%  classifier       a data structure containing a sac classifier
