function classifier = sacTrain_LogitBoost_Weka(data, parameters)
% classifier = sacTrain_LogitBoost_Weka(data, parameters)
% Trains a LogitBoost classifier using the WEKA library. 
%
% INPUT:
%  data:            a sac data structure containing the training data
%  parameters:      a string containing options for training. Options
%                   include
%                   -norm Data normalization type
%                   -H Hueristic stop. If > 0, the heuristic for greedy 
%                      stopping while cross-validating the number of 
%                      LogitBoost iterations is enabled. This means 
%                      LogitBoost is stopped if no new error minimum has 
%                      been reached in the last heuristicStop iterations.
%                   -M Max boosting iterations.
%                   -I Sets fixed number of boosting iterations.
%                   -W Sets beta value for weight trimming.
%
% OUTPUT:
%  classifier       a data structure containing a sac classifier
