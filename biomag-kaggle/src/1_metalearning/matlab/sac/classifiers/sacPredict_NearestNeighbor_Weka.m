function [y, p] = sacPredict_NearestNeighbor_Weka(classifier, data)
% [y, p] = sacPredict_NearestNeighbor_Weka(classifier, data)
% Applies a nearest neighbor classifier using the WEKA library to data. 
%
% INPUT:
%  classifier:  a data structure containing a sac classifier provided
%               by sacTrain
%  data:        a sac data structure containing the training data
%
% OUTPUT:
%  y:           vector containing predicted classes for each data instance    
%  p:           matrix containing probability distribution for all classes
