% classifier = sacTrain_KNN_Weka(data, parameters)
% Trains a K-neareset neighbors classifier using the WEKA library. 
%
% INPUT:
%  data:            a sac data structure containing the training data
%  parameters:      a string containing options for training. Options
%                   include
%                   -norm Data normalization type
%                   -soft   PMAX probability of predicted class < 1
%                   -K      Number of nearest neighbors
%                   -W      Max number of instances in training pool. 0 
%                           results in no limit to # of training points.
%                   -I      1/distance weighting
%                   -F      1-distance  
%                   -A      Search method for nearest neighbors
