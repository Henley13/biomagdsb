function L = sacAll2Labels(B)
% L = sacAll2Labels(L)
% Converts a class-wise matrix of size NxM (N instances, M classes) into an Nx1
% vector containing the predicted class indexes.
%
% INPUT:
%  B                A NxM matrix with values predicting the probability of
%                   the instance belonging to each class.
%
% OUTPUT:
%  L:               A Nx1 vector containing maximum class labels.
