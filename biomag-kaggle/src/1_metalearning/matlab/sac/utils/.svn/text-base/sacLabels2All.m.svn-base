% Converts a vector of size Nx1 containing M class labels into a binary
% matrix of size NxM.
%
% INPUT:
%  L:               A Nx1 vector containing true class labels.
%  labelList:       A 1xM cell containing a list of the possible labels. 
%
% OUTPUT:
%  B                A NxM binary matrix with 1's indicating true class
%                   labels.
%  inds:            A 1xM cell sorted according to the order.
