    % Correct for the saw-tooth shape of the PR curve
    % Precision-recall curves have a distinctive saw-tooth shape: 
    % if the  document retrieved is nonrelevant then recall is the 
    % same as for the top  documents, but precision has dropped. If 
    % it is relevant, then both precision and recall increase, and 
    % the curve jags up and to the right. It is often useful to remove 
    % these jiggles and the standard way to do this is with an 
    % interpolated precision: the interpolated precision   
    % at a certain recall level  is defined as the highest 
    % precision found for any recall level. From:
