function [ACC ERR COR INC] = sacAccuracy(y, p)
% [ACC ERR COR INC] = sacAccuracy(labels, predictions)
% Computes overall accuracy of a classifier.
%
% INPUT:
%  labels:           A vector containing true class labels.
%  predictions:      A vector containing the predicted class labels.
%
% OUTPUT:
%  ACC               Overall classification accuracy.
%  ERR               Overall classification error rate.
%  COR               Total number of correctly classified instances.
%  INC               Total number of incorrectly classified instances.
